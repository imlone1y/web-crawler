for the first day, i learn how to collect the website's data, and turn into json and excel file.

import BeautifulSoup4, requests and pandas to help me using the tools.

i have to tell the website as i'm a user but not a python crawler by using "User-Agent".

use requests to collect the data that website return to me.
